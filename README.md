Brain Tumor Prediction with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Introduction
What is a brain tumor?
A brain tumor is a collection or mass of abnormal cells in your brain.

How are brain tumors diagnosed?
Brain tumors are diagnosed in three phases:

A neurological exam
Brain scans
Biopsy
What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning neural network optimized for image and video processing tasks.

Why are we using this process?
CNNs are fully connected and feed-forward neural networks. Given their structure, they are particularly adept at processing images with high dimensionality, reducing the number of parameters without compromising on performance.

Data Preprocessing
Normalize the data
The DataGenerator rescales the pixel values of images by dividing them by 255, a common normalization step for image data.

Model Creation
To initiate our model, we use the following structure:
