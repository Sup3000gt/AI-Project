# Brain Tumor Prediction with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
### Introduction
##### What is a brain tumor?
A brain tumor is a collection or mass of abnormal cells in your brain.

##### How are brain tumors diagnosed?
Brain tumors are diagnosed in three phases:

- A neurological exam
- Brain scans
- Biopsy

#### What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning neural network optimized for image and video processing tasks.

#### Why are we using this process?
CNNs are fully connected and feed-forward neural networks. Given their structure, they are particularly adept at processing images with high dimensionality, reducing the number of parameters without compromising on performance.

#### Data Preprocessing
Normalize the data
The DataGenerator rescales the pixel values of images by dividing them by 255, a common normalization step for image data.



#### Interpretations
##### Benefits
1. Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy with a low rate of false negatives, meaning fewer necessary human corrections.
2. Performance: Quick processing attributed to the inclusion of max-pooling layers, which reduce the sample space.
3. Efficiency: The model assists examiners by quickly classifying images, allowing them to focus on validation.
4. Kernel Size: The large image size means that a larger kernel size can be initially utilized, improving high-level feature extraction.
#### Limitations
1. Sample Size: The small number of samples does not meet the rigorous standards demanded in the medical field.
2. Data Pre-processing: There's potential for refining the data preprocessing steps.
3. Image Constraints: The current approach doesn't focus solely on the brain area. This leads to extra dark padding and the presence of unrelated words or symbols in the data.
4. Reliability: Doctors are still required to verify the model's predictions.
Summary
The Goal
The project's essence lies in leveraging a CNN to accurately identify brain tumors from MRI scans. By employing a deep learning algorithm, this model learns patterns distinguishing between normal and tumor tissues from a large dataset. Our primary aim is to bolster early detection, a crucial step towards successful treatment and improved patient prognosis.

#### Key Takeaways
1. CNNs are instrumental in image analysis, thanks to their deep learning capabilities.
2. A sizable dataset is essential to harness the full potential of CNNs.
3. Prompt detection and diagnosis pave the way for effective medical interventions.
4. The model, albeit promising, still warrants further enhancement and validation.
#### Future Applications & Research
1. Model Refinement: Enhance the CNN's predictive prowess by exploring diverse architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies.
2. Platform Development: Design a user-friendly software application or web platform incorporating the CNN, assisting clinicians in interpreting X-ray scans and detecting brain tumors.
3. Diverse Dataset: Incorporate a broader range of brain tumors and imaging techniques, including CT and PET scans.
4. Real-world Validation: Assess the CNN model's efficacy in actual clinical scenarios to ascertain its diagnostic utility.
5. Multimodal Imaging: Explore amalgamating different imaging methods, like MRI and CT, to further improve tumor detection.
6. Broader Applications: Probe into the CNN's applicability for other medical imaging tasks, such as detecting tumors or abnormalities in different organs.
